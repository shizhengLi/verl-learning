# Reinforcement Learning Interview Questions

## Basic RL Questions

### Foundational Concepts

1. **What is Reinforcement Learning and how does it differ from supervised learning?**
   - RL involves an agent learning through interaction with an environment
   - No labeled data; agent learns from rewards/punishments
   - Sequential decision making vs. single prediction
   - Exploration vs. exploitation trade-off

2. **Explain the key components of a Reinforcement Learning system:**
   - **Agent**: The learner/decision maker
   - **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
   - **State**: Current situation of the agent
   - **Action**: What the agent can do
   - **Reward**: Feedback from the environment
   - **Policy**: Agent's strategy for choosing actions

3. **What is the Markov Property and why is it important in RL?**
   - Future state depends only on current state and action
   - Memoryless property simplifies decision making
   - Enables use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
   - Foundation for most RL algorithms

4. **Explain the difference between Value-based and Policy-based methods:**
   - **Value-based**: Learn value function, derive policy from it (e.g., Q-learning)
   - **Policy-based**: Directly learn policy function (e.g., REINFORCE)
   - **Actor-Critic**: Combine both approaches

5. **What is the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma?**
   - Balance between trying new actions and using known good actions
   - Exploration: gathering more information
   - Exploitation: making best decisions based on current knowledge
   - Strategies: ε-greedy, UCB, Thompson sampling

### Q-Learning and DQN
